## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)
We want to compare first one simple traffic intersection, either organised by a crossroad with priority to the right 
(with or without a light), or by a roundabout. Secondly we add crosswalks. If we are capable we'd like to place
two or three intersections one after another in a line. 
When I go buying bread for breakfast, I have to cross the Albisriederplatz in Zürich. During rush hour in the morning and evening,
sometimes the whole day, 

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)

flow
Ampelgündauer
Fussgängerflow
Abstand der intersections
1dim
out over in as a measure of efficiency
possible extension with Schneckenberg

## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )

## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)

## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)
