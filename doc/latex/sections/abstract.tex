\section{Abstract}
In our simulation, based on cellular automata, we have tried to compare roundabouts to crossroads, controlled by traffic lights, with respect to the traffic flow. We defined the flow as the product of car density and average speed of the cars. Our main input parameters are car density and pedestrian density. 
Some results here???
