\section{Abstract}
In our simulation, based on cellular automata, we have tried to compare roundabouts to crossroads, controlled by traffic lights, with respect to the traffic flow. We defined the traffic flow as the product of car density and average speed of the cars. Whereever reasonable, the Nagel-Schreckenberg model has been implemented. The main input parameters are car density and pedestrian density. There are three different signalisation modes of the trafficlight, depending on the pedestrian density. We expected roundabouts to be more efficient at low pedestrian densities for every car-density, but if pedestrian density rises the advantage should melt. Indeed, we have found, that the flow decreases approximately linearly to zero with the pedestrian-density rising after having reached the maximum in roundabouts. In contrast, the flow in crossroad is, as expected, rather low but never vanishes.
